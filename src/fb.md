# First Block

## Choosing your Orientation

x2y neutrality is highly recommended. It is the minimal orientation that enables you to use ANY premade pairs. If you adopt y or x2y2 instead, the probability of using a premade pair is reduced by half, so you'll get more difficult cases on average, but it's still somewhat acceptable. Anything below y or x2y2 would heavily limit your choices, and is recommended against.


<!-- (on a side note: x2y2 means that you're more sensitive to the L/R sides as their colors are fixed.  ) -->

Regarding full CN: it is a plus, but the benefits have not been proven as there has yet to be a world class full CN Rouxer. Some speculate the benefits would be minimal because there is limited time during inspection to analyse all 24 FB options. However, a counterpoint would be that for any first square, you have two choices of last pair to extend to a FB, making the last pair case much better on average. Therefore, once you find a good first square, you can usually settle on it and make better use of your inspection time by looking further into the solve. 

TL;DR: CN Roux is worth exploring, but don't force yourself.

If you are interested in the average movecount comparison of FB or FB + DR under different orientations, use the following resource:

- [Movecount statistics](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EectP3O_qwQp_2WohbDrlohxhs2ee17sjFfxZr_-D1g/edit#gid=0) - Notice how x2y boosts chance of easy first square compared to y from 60% to 80%.

## Blockbuilding Strategies

There are broadly speaking two families of FB building strategy: square + pair and line + line. See resources below:

## Turning

- You want to have calm and fluid turning for two reasons:
    - You need to give yourself time to track SB pieces, and turning too fast can result in losing track of pieces.
    - FB is a bad moveset group that generally involve both F and B moves. It is intrinsically more difficult to fingertrick. If you rush, you could overshoot or get your grips wrong, resulting in bad lockups.

-  Plan out your fingertricks in inspection too:
   - Unlike the rest of the solve, FB fingertricking requires your active attention. You should limit your regrips and eliminate pauses between moves. Try to figure all these out in inspection --- This can be just as important as planning out the actual solution! Over time, you'll grow familiar and be able to plan fingertricks automatically.

- Also, develop a preference for what pairs / triggers are easy for you to execute over time, and try to prioritize them in your FB solution. Use this to guide your FB planning instead of move count as this is more precise and correlated to actual times.

## How To Bring your inspection down to 15 seconds


- [Partial SpeedBLD technique by Kian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KLFyN6ZDwk) - This is definitely underrated as a practice approach! Do them regularly as warmup before solves!
